Have you ever wondered how apps like
this one are making $500,000
every single month? And well, what if I
told you that I just built an exact copy
of this million-doll app without writing
a single line of code? Now, I can hear
you thinking already, but if you check
out this screenshot, you can see proof
of the revenue that this type of app
generates through the app store. Half a
million dollars every month. And here's
a crazier part. I used only one AI tool
to build the entire thing. Now, most
people think that you need years of
coding experience or a whole team of
developers to create profitable apps,
but that's completely wrong. I'm about
to show you the exact stepby-step
process that I use to recreate this
successful workout tracking app, connect
it to Stripe for payments, and set up
all the premium features without
touching a single line of code. By the
way, my name is Mikey M I K E Y and I've
been experimenting with AI development
tools for the past year. And what I
discovered is that there's one AI coding
tool right now that's absolutely
crushing everything else. And it can
literally build entire apps for you. In
this video, I'm going to walk you
through my complete process. I'm gonna
show you the exact tool that I used and
I'm going to prove that anyone, you, me,
even complete beginners can build
profitable apps in 2025. So, if you've
ever wanted to create your own app or
make money from app development or we're
just super curious about what's possible
with AI right now, this video, I promise
you, is going to blow your mind. So,
let's go ahead and dive right in. The AI
tool that will take care of everything
for us today in this video will be
Rocket. new. I added a special link in
the description below so you can go
ahead and check it out for yourself,
too. So, whenever I'm starting with a
new app build, the very first thing that
I want to do is get a layout down,
something that shows you how everything
will be structured before we begin
layering in features. It's pretty much
like sketching the blueprint of a house
before deciding on the furniture. Now,
this first step will give us a clear
picture of how the app will flow and
it'll also set the foundation for
everything we're going to add in later.
So, for this build, again, we'll be
using Rocket. And one of the biggest
advantages here of using Rocket is code
ownership. Unlike other platforms that
lock you in, you own your own code
completely. You can download it, you can
modify it, you can host it anywhere you
want. Even if you cancel your
subscription, your apps and your code
remain yours forever. All right, so
here's what we're going to tell Rocket.
Hey, Rocket, let's build an awesome
mobile fitness app. First, please build
the UI of the app. Then, we'll add some
features afterwards. Please build all
the sections and the navbar needed. All
right, before we move on, important
disclaimer here because building apps
and making money online is not easy
despite what other YouTubers might be
saying. So, when I show you how to build
an app, for example, I'm demonstrating
the technical process and the potential.
I am not guaranteeing your results.
These AI tools are legit, and as you'll
see, the techniques do work, but
success, as with all things in life,
depends on your execution, your timing,
and honestly, some luck. Now, most apps
don't make money right away. and many
don't even make money at all. So, I'm
not promising you're going to get rich
or that you go out and quit your job
after this video. Now, this is not
financial advice or a get-rich quick
scheme. I'm just showing you what's
possible with these tools and what you
do with that knowledge is up to you. All
right, so with those expectations set,
let's go ahead and continue building
this app. So, Rocket responds by putting
together a clean, elegant design for our
fitness app. All the major sections are
there. The placeholders are neatly set
and the overall look already feels
polished even at this early stage. It is
simple but it gives us a working canvas
that we can start refining right away.
So let's go ahead and look through the
app. And you can see here that the
structure is functional. But there is a
small error. The navbar doesn't appear
on the home screen which might make the
navigation look incomplete at first. But
if I do tap into one of the sections,
the navbar appears and it works as
expected. So it is a promising start.
But the next step will make sure that
the navbar shows up everywhere so that
our navigation feels seamless from the
very beginning. Now that we've got the
basic layout in place, we are now going
to go ahead and take things up a notch.
Now the first version gave us a solid
foundation, but the design still feels
pretty bare bones to me. and that navbar
isn't showing up consistently across our
app. So, what I want next is a cleaner,
more modern look that works like a
proper fitness app and of course a fully
working navbar that ties the whole
experience together. So, to accomplish
all of that, here's what we're going to
ask Rocket. Great job, Rocket. Now,
please improve the app's design. Give it
a modern exercise look and add a navbar
and the other sections we may need.
focus on this first, then we'll build
more functionality later. And Rocket
comes back with a much more polished
design. As you can see, the layout has
been updated to look like a real
exercise app. It's modern, it's
cohesive, and it's visually appealing.
On top of all of that, we now have a
responsive navbar that shows up
consistently, which does let us move
smoothly between different sections.
Now, another cool thing here is that
Rocket just doesn't design from scratch.
Say you already have a mockup sitting in
Figma. Well, you can upload that
directly into Rocket and it will turn it
into production ready code with pixel
perfect accuracy. And that means no
messy handoffs to other developers and
no it doesn't match the design kind of
frustrations because your app looks
exactly how you imagined it and designed
it. And speaking of design, you can see
the difference here right away. In this
updated build, the sections are more
connected, the design flows better, and
that navbar ties everything together in
a way that makes navigation seamless.
Now, this upgrade gives us the
confidence to move forward. Knowing that
our app doesn't just work structurally,
but also looks the part. Okay, so a
fitness app without a workout tracker
doesn't really make much sense. So, this
is where we start building out the core
functionality. And the goal here is to
let our users create their own workouts,
track their own progress, and have that
flexibility to manage sessions however
they want. So, let's make that happen by
sending Rocket this kind of prompt.
Great job, Rocket. Let's focus on
building the actual functionality.
Please create a workout tracker and a
creator feature where the user can
create their own custom workouts and
track their progress in said workouts.
Give them the ability to add notes and
progress photos in the workout plans
they created. Also, give them the
ability to add exercises or sets while a
workout they created is in progress.
Lastly, give them the ability to be able
to finish workouts that they started at
any time without completing all the
exercises. And now, the workflow
delivers a fully functional workout
tracker inside of our app. And our users
can now design custom workout plans.
They can attach notes. They can include
their own progress photos and add or
remove sets as they go. And one of the
best parts is that workouts, they don't
have to be fully completed to end a
session. And this gives our users more
realistic control over how they train.
Okay, so let's go ahead and try all of
that out. I'll create a workout called,
say, calisthenics. And I'm going to
start adding exercises. So first I'll
add some push-ups and then some planks.
But I'm also going to go ahead and try
to delete the planks. And there you go,
the delete button works. And if
something ever doesn't work, as
expected, Rocket's builtin error
detection will spot it and then offers a
one-click fix. So instead of having to
dig through a bunch of code, we can just
hit fix it and then move on. And after
checking that, I'll follow it up with
some burpees. I'll save the workout. And
then now I'm going to activate it. From
here, the app lets me run the workout.
And if I decide to finish early, I can
go ahead and close it out without
needing to complete every last set. So,
it's flexible, it's practical, and it
feels like a real fitness tracker that
adapts to our users. Every good fitness
app needs a knowledge base that users
can rely on, not just for tracking their
own workouts, but also for guidance and
for ideas. And right now, the library
section in our app has just been
placeholder. So, it's now time to turn
that into a real resource. And this
means giving our users access to a
complete workout database filled with
details and instructions that they can
use at any time. So, here's the prompt
we're going to send over to Rocket to
make that all happen. Awesome job,
Rocket. Now, please build the workout
library/database.
create a thorough database with
instructions and details for several
workouts ranging from cardio,
weightlifting, calisthenics, and body
weight and the like. And with that,
Rocket built out a full workout library
inside of our app. And now, instead of
empty placeholders, that section is now
populated with a variety of exercises
across different categories. And each
entry comes with clear instructions and
details so that our users can follow
along and incorporate new routines into
their own training. Doing this
transforms the library into more than
just a section of the app. It's now a
built-in guide to help our users reach
their fitness goals. All right, let's go
ahead and explore this new database. So,
I'm going to head into the library here
and I'm going to start scrolling through
some of the options. Now, unlike before
where everything just kind of looked
empty and unfinished, this section, as
you can see, now holds real content. And
like what I said earlier, the workout
entry now includes instructions and
details, which makes our app much more
complete and gives our users a reliable
source of reference whenever they need
or want to try something new in their
programming. We all know that workouts
are great on their own, but many people
do prefer following structured programs
that lay out routines week by week. So,
for this next step, I want to expand our
library into something bigger, not just
individual workouts, but full-on
training programs like starting strength
and strong lifts 5x5. This will give
users a clear road map complete with
principles and progression instead of
just leaving them to piece things
together on their own. And to do that,
all it takes is this prompt and Rocket
will handle the rest for us. Awesome
job, Rocket. Now, please expand our
application by creating optimized
programs in our workout library. Please
create optimized programs such as
starting strength, strong lifts, 5x5,
and the like. And from that prompt, we
get an expanded program library right
inside of our app. So instead of just
exercises, we now have full-fledged
programs that break down training into
steps, routines, and guiding principles.
And these programs provide structure for
anyone who wants a proven system to
follow like 5x5. And they even include
the extra details like nutrition advice
to keep the experience well-rounded. All
right, so check this out. We can see
here under the new program section a
full list of structured and training
plans is ready to explore and opening
them up reveals complete routines, clear
principles and supporting details that
you know go beyond just exercises, even
touching on nutrition. Now, compared to
where we started off in this video, this
addition turns our app into a guide that
can now carry our users through an
entire fitness journey all step by step.
Now, after all that building and
refining, I think it's now finally time
to, you know, step back and see how
everything comes together. So, I'm going
to walk you through the app section by
section. Now, here, each part looks
complete and it's all connected now
seamlessly. Our app no longer is just a
collection of features, but it is a
cohesive fitness platform. So, let's put
the workout creator to the test. I'll go
into the workout section here. I'm going
to start building a new routine. I'll
also add a mix of different exercises.
I'll save the plan and then I'm just
going to launch it. And while running
the workout, I am going to drop in some
personal notes of mine and even upload a
progress photo to show how flexible the
feature really is. And just like we
designed earlier, I'm able to finish the
workout early without having to complete
every exercise. Now, let's go ahead and
move into the program library to check
out these specialized training programs
that we recently added. And there you
go. It is a library, a planner, and a
workout companion all in one place. Now,
by this point, I'm hoping that we can
all agree this doesn't feel just like a
prototype anymore. Because while other
platforms struggle to make mobile apps
actually work, Rocket generates real
Flutter apps that run seamlessly across
both iOS and Android with true native
performance. And on top of that, it
gives you a readymade frame on the back
end. So you can choose whether to build
a web app, a mobile app, or even an
internal tool. Okay, so now that we've
seen how the app functions as a whole,
it's, you know, time to add another
feature because why not? That makes
workouts more practical in real life.
And one feature that every fitness app
needs is a reliable timer because I
don't want to open another app. So
whether it's for rest periods, circuit
training, or just keeping workout
structured, having a timer built
directly into the dashboard makes the
whole experience more seamless. And to
do that, we'll guide Rocket with this
prompt to get the feature built in.
Awesome. Now, please create a timer in
the home and dashboard. This should be
at the front. Make the default time as 2
minutes, which can be customized and
edited manually. Also below the timer
have a selection from our existing
workouts that the user can tap. So the
timer starts automatically displaying
the workout. Okay, so the output for
that gives us a dedicated timer right
here on our dashboard. It isn't just a
standalone tool either. It also doubles
as a quick start option for any workout
that we choose since all the routines
we've created are listed right below it.
and that way we can jump straight into
training without any extra steps. So to
showcase this, I'm going to go ahead and
run through a quick test. I'll adjust
the timer settings here by changing the
minutes. I'm also going to try out the
reset start and stop buttons just to
make sure everything works smoothly. And
after that, I'm just going to go ahead
and pick one of the workouts from the my
workouts section. And just like we
planned, the timer automatically starts
with that routine that I just chose.
Now, so when it comes to fitness, right,
fitness apps, nothing's more motivating
than actually seeing your own progress.
And that's why the final piece we're
adding is a proper progress tracker,
something that goes beyond just logging
workouts and really shows us how far
we've come. So, I'm going to ask Rocket
to build out a full progress section,
stats, body measurements, and photo
tracking to tie everything together.
something like this. Great job, Rocket.
Now, let's focus on building the
progress tracking feature and
statistics. Please build the progress
section and allow the user to track
their progress with advanced statistics
that show personal records and
progression. Also add a body
measurements tracker for weight and
vitals and give the ability to upload
and add photos of the user's progress.
And the output for that shows that the
app now has a working progress tracking
section and everything inside of it is
functional and it is ready to use. So
let's go ahead and try to upload a
simple progress photo, then track my
weight and body part measurements here
and instantly the analytics will pop up
showing clear stats and progression
trends. It's surprisingly satisfying to
watch the numbers and the visuals all
line up, and it's all proof that the
workouts and the routines are paying
off. At this point, the app has plenty
of features, but without accounts and
authentication, it really is just a
single user experience. So, in order to
make it feel like a complete platform,
our next step is to hook it up with
Superbase and add proper login and
signup pages. The setup starts by
heading over to my Superbase here,
creating a new project, then going into
the integration panel back in Rocket,
and then just linking that project into
our app. And once that's ready, here's
the prompt we'll use. Now, please
integrate Superbase and create the login
and sign up pages. Also, make sure that
the profile section shows the loggedin
user. And with that, Rocket takes care
of the integration and generates a clean
authentication flow. And we now have
dedicated login and signup screens along
with user account handling powered by
Superbase. And along with that, the app
automatically pulls in profile
information so that our logged in users
name shows up right here on the
dashboard and in the profile section.
And this isn't just a demo either
because when Rocket adds Superbase
authentication or later on Stripe
payments, it is production ready
functionality. It's not placeholder
code. So you can connect your accounts
and then start processing real login or
payments right away. And with that,
let's go ahead and test all of that out.
I'm going to create a fresh account
here. I'm going to sign in and I'm going
to move into the app. And everything so
far works smoothly. The signup goes
through. The login directs me straight
to my dashboard and my name displays
exactly where it should. All right. So
far, we've built a ton of features,
tracking, and authentication. But to
really turn this into a business, we
need a way to monetize it. And we'll be
needing Stripe here. And the idea here
is simple, which is to give users a
smooth upgrade path so that they can
unlock everything that our app has to
offer. And to do that, I'm going to head
over to my Stripe. I'm going to grab the
publishable and secret keys. And then
I'm simply going to plug them into
Rocket's integration panel under the
Stripe section. And after setting that
up, I'm just going to drop in this final
prompt. Great job, Rocket. Now, lastly,
please integrate Stripe and have a
simple checkout link using the keys that
I provided. Please create a new section
called upgrade. And within that section,
show the details and benefits of our
app's premium upgrade. At the bottom of
the section, we have a checkout button
which redirects to Stripe. And with that
prompt, Rocket instantly adds an upgrade
tab to our app right here. And inside,
users can see exactly what Premium
offers. Advanced tracking, expanded
features, and all the little extras that
we added earlier that set it apart.
There's also a checkout button that
connects directly to Stripe. So,
subscribing really just takes one click.
And once the subscription goes through,
the app confirms the account is premium
and then it unlocks all of that good
gated content. All right, so now I'm
going to try and see if all of this
works out. So let's navigate to the new
upgrade section here. Let's go ahead and
review the benefits. Let's hit checkout
and now complete a test subscription.
And right after that, as you can see,
the dashboard updates with a premium
status. No hiccups, no confusion. And
now that Stripe is in place, the app
officially has everything it needs to
not just support our users, but also
sustain itself as a real product. And
for the final run through, I'm going to
go ahead and start things off by
creating a brand new account, say
calling it Fit Rocket because why not?
And after signing in, I'll move through
the app the way any user would, checking
out each section as if I'm using it for
the first time. Now, here in the
workouts tab, I'm going to put together
a custom routine. I'm going to add a few
personal notes and I'll upload a quick
progress photo before finishing the
session to show how flexible the feature
is. And after that, I'm going to head
over to the timer here and I'm going to
play around with it, setting it to say
10 minutes just to test how smooth it
feels. Then I'll jump into the program
library. I'm going to pick out a
training program and I'm going to walk
through the routines and subcategories
that it comes with. And from there, I'll
visit the exercise library and pull up
some of the detailed instructions for
individual exercises. I'll also log my
weight and my body measurements in the
progress tracker so that we can see how
that data gets recorded. Lastly, I'll
open up the upgrade section here. I'm
going to go through the premium checkout
flow and then I'm going to reload the
app to confirm that my profile now shows
premium status. And it's the complete
experience now from signing up as a new
user to unlocking every single feature.
All right, that's a wrap on today's
video. I'll catch you down here in the
comments section below. I'm always
looking forward to hearing your feedback
and of course, thank you for spending
your time with me today and I'll
definitely catch you at the next one.
Thanks for watching.
