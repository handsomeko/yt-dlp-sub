1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Have you ever wondered how apps like this one are making $500,000 every single month?

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
Well, what if I told you that I just built an exact copy of this million dollar app without

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
writing a single line of code? Now, I can hear you thinking already, but if you check out the

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,519
screenshot, you can see proof of the revenue that this type of app generates through the app store.

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:28,960
Half a million dollars every month, and here's a crazier part I used only one AI tool to build the

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,719
entire thing. Now, most people think that you need years of coding experience or a whole team of

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,079
developers to create profitable apps, but that's completely wrong. I'm about to show you the exact

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,960
step-by-step process that I use to recreate this successful workout tracking app, connect it to

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,640
Stripe for payments, and set up all of the premium features without touching a single line of code.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,880
By the way, my name is Mikey, and my K-E-Y, and I've been experimenting with AI development tools

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,519
for the past year, and what I discovered is that there's one AI coding tool right now that's

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,920
absolutely crushing everything else, and it can literally build entire apps for you. In this video,

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,519
I'm going to walk you through my complete process. I'm going to show you the exact tool that I used,

14
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:23,439
and I'm going to prove that anyone you, me, even complete beginners, can build profitable apps in

15
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,399
2025. So, if you've ever wanted to create your own app, or make money from app development, or

16
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:35,599
we're just super curious about what's possible with AI right now, this video I promise you

17
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,159
is going to blow your mind. So, let's go ahead and dive right in. The AI tool that will take care of

18
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,879
everything for us today in this video will be Rocket.New. I added a special link in the description below,

19
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,399
so you can go ahead and check it out for yourself too. So, whenever I'm starting with a new app

20
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,640
build, the very first thing that I want to do is get a layout down. Something that shows you how

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,560
everything will be structured before we begin layering in features. It's pretty much like sketching

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
the blueprint of a house before deciding on the furniture. Now, this first step will give us a

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,280
clear picture of how the app will flow, and it'll also set the foundation for everything we're

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,159
going to add in later. So, for this build, again, we'll be using Rocket, and one of the biggest

25
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,080
advantages here of using Rocket is code ownership. Unlike other platforms that lock you in,

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,159
you own your own code completely. You can download it, you can modify it, you can post it anywhere

27
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,400
you want, even if you cancel your subscription, your apps, and your code remain yours forever.

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
All right, so here's what we're going to tell Rocket. Hey Rocket, let's build an awesome

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,520
mobile fitness app. First, please build the UI of the app, then we'll add some features

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,439
afterwards. Please build all the sections and the nav bar needed. All right, before we move on,

31
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,879
important disclaimer here, because building apps and making money online is not easy, despite

32
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,000
what other YouTubers might be saying. So, when I show you how to build an app, for example,

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm demonstrating the technical process and the potential. I am not guaranteeing your results.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,199
These AI tools are legit, and as you'll see, the techniques do work, but success as with all

35
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,000
things in life depends on your execution, your timing, and honestly some luck. Now most apps don't

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,520
make money right away, and many don't even make money at all. So, I'm not promising you're going

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,560
to get rich or that you go out and quit your job after this video. Now, this is not financial advice,

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,599
or a get rich quick scheme. I'm just showing you what's possible with these tools, and what you do

39
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,360
that knowledge is up to you. All right, so with those expectations set, let's go ahead and continue

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,759
building this app. So, Rocket responds by putting together a clean, elegant design for our fitness app.

41
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,000
All the major sections are there, the placeholders are neatly set, and the overall look already

42
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,319
feels polished even at this early stage. It is simple, but it gives us a working canvas that we

43
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,639
can start refining right away. So, let's go ahead and look through the app, and you can see here that

44
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,840
the structure is functional, but there is a small error. The nav bar doesn't appear on the home screen,

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,639
which might make the navigation look incomplete at first. But if I do tap into one of the sections,

46
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:28,560
the nav bar appears, and it works as expected. So, it is a promising start, but in the next step,

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,319
we'll make sure that the nav bar shows up everywhere so that our navigation feels seamless from

48
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,000
the very beginning. Now that we've got the basic layout in place, we are now going to go ahead and

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,959
take things up a notch. Now, the first version gave us a solid foundation, but the design still feels

50
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:53,359
pretty bare bones to me, and that nav bar isn't showing up consistently across our app. So,

51
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:59,359
what I want next is a cleaner, more modern look that works like a proper fitness app, and of course,

52
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:04,719
a fully working nav bar that ties the whole experience together. So, to accomplish all of that,

53
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:09,839
here's what we're going to ask Rocket, great job Rocket. Now, please improve the app's design,

54
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,839
give it a modern exercise look, and add a nav bar, and the other sections we may need focus on this

55
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,000
first, then we'll build more functionality later. And Rocket comes back with a much more polished

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,399
design. As you can see, the layout has been updated to look like a real exercise app, it's modern,

57
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,959
it's cohesive, and it's visually appealing. On top of all of that, we now have a responsive nav bar

58
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,719
that shows up consistently, which does let us move smoothly between different sections. Now,

59
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,360
another cool thing here is that Rocket just doesn't design scratch. Say, you already have a mock-up

60
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,360
sitting in Figma. Well, we can upload that directly into Rocket, and it will turn it into production

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,600
ready code with pixel-perfect accuracy. And that means no messy hand-offs to other developers,

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,440
and no, it doesn't manage the design kind of frustrations. Because your app looks exactly how you

63
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,000
imagined it and designed it. And speaking of design, you can see the difference here, right away,

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,920
and this updated build, these sections are more connected, the design flows better, and that nav

65
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,079
bar ties everything together in a way that makes navigation seamless. Now, this upgrade gives us the

66
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,720
confidence to move forward, knowing that our app doesn't just work structurally, but also looks the

67
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,199
part. Okay, so a fitness app without a workout tracker doesn't really make my sense. So this is where

68
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,439
we start building out the core functionality. And the goal here is to let our users create their

69
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:47,360
own workouts, track their own progress, and have that flexibility to manage sessions, however they

70
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,279
want. So let's make that happen by sending Rocket this kind of prompt. Great job Rocket. Let's focus

71
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,680
on building the actual functionality. Please create a workout tracker and a creator feature,

72
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,560
where the user can create their own custom workouts and track their progress in set workouts.

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,800
Give them the ability to add notes and progress photos in the workout plans they created. Also,

74
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,920
give them the ability to add exercises or sets while a workout they created is in progress.

75
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,759
Lastly, give them the ability to be able to finish workouts that they started at any time without

76
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,879
completing all the exercises. And now the workflow delivers a fully functional workout tracker

77
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,399
inside of our app. And our users can now design custom workout plans. They can attach notes,

78
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,680
they can include their own progress photos and add or remove sets as they go. And one of the best

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,000
parts is that workouts they don't have to be fully completed to a session. And this gives our

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,079
users more realistic control over how they train. Okay, so let's go ahead and try all of that out.

81
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,199
I'll create a workout called say calspanics and I'm going to start adding exercises. So first,

82
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,439
I'll add some push-ups and then some planks. But I'm also going to go ahead and try to delete the

83
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,839
planks. And there you go, the delete button works. And if something ever doesn't work as expected,

84
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:18,399
Rocket's built-in error detection will spot it and then offers a one-click fix. So instead of

85
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,199
having to dig through a bunch of code, we can just hit fix it and then move on. And after checking

86
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,239
that, I'll follow it up with some burpees. I'll save the workouts and then now I'm going to activate

87
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:34,639
it. From here, the app lets me run the workout. And if I decide to finish early, I can go ahead and

88
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:41,120
close it out without needing to complete a real asset. So it's flexible, it's practical, and it

89
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,000
feels like a real fitness tracker that adapts to our users. Every good fitness app needs a knowledge

90
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,639
base that users can rely on not just for tracking their own workouts, but also for guidance and

91
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:01,279
for ideas. Right now, the library section in our app has just been placeholder. So it's now time

92
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,200
to turn that into a real resource. And this means giving our users access to a complete workout

93
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,720
database filled with details and instructions that they can use at any time. So here's the prompt

94
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,639
we're going to send over to Rocket to make that all happen. Awesome job Rocket. Now please build the

95
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:26,320
workout library slash database, create a thorough database with instructions and details for several

96
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,200
workouts ranging from cardio, weightlifting, calisthenics, and body weight and the like. And with that,

97
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,720
Rocket built out a full workout library inside of our app. And now instead of empty place folders,

98
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,399
that section is now populated with a variety of exercises across different categories. And each

99
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,120
entry comes with clear instructions and details so that our users can follow along and incorporate

100
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,200
new routines into their own training. Doing this transforms the library into more than just a

101
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,040
section of the app. It's now a built in guide to help our users reach their fitness goals.

102
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright, let's go ahead and explore this new database. So I'm going to head into the library here

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,399
and I'm going to start scrolling through some of the options that unlike before or everything just

104
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,240
kind of looked empty and unfinished. This section as you can see now holds real content. And look what I

105
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,960
said earlier, the workout entry now includes instructions and details which makes our app much more

106
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,279
complete and gives our users a reliable source of reference whenever they need or want to try

107
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,039
something new in their programming. We all know that workouts are great on their own but many people

108
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:43,759
do prefer following structured programs that lay out routines week by week. So for this next

109
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:50,559
step, I want to expand our library into something bigger, not just individual workouts but full-on

110
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,559
training programs like starting strength and strong lifts five by five. This will give users a clear

111
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,639
roadmap complete with principles and progression instead of just leaving them to piece things together

112
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,399
and to do that all it takes is this prop and rocket will handle the rest for us. Awesome job

113
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,279
rocket. Now please expand our application by creating optimized programs in our workout library.

114
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,439
Please create optimized programs such as starting strength, strong lifts, five by five and the

115
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:28,000
like. And from that problem, we get an expanded program library right inside of our app. So instead of

116
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:35,039
just exercises, we now have full-fledged programs that break down training into steps, routines,

117
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,120
and guiding principles. And these programs provide structure for anyone who wants to prove in

118
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,639
system to follow like five by five and they even include the extra details like nutrition advice

119
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,600
to keep the experience well rounded. All right, so check this out. We can see here under the

120
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,320
new program section, a full list of structured training plans is ready to explore and opening them

121
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,480
up reveals complete routines, clear principles, and supporting details that go beyond just exercises.

122
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,759
Even touching on nutrition, now compared to where we started off in this video, this addition

123
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,160
turns our app into a guide that can now carry our users through an entire fitness journey all step

124
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:24,319
by step. Now after all that building and refining, I think it's now finally time to step back and

125
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:29,360
see how everything comes together. So I'm going to walk you through the app section by section.

126
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,679
Now here, each part looks complete and it's all connected now seamlessly. Our app no longer is just

127
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,360
a collection of features, but it is a cohesive fitness platform. So let's put the workout creator

128
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,319
to the test. I'll go into the workout section here. I'm going to start building a new routine. I'll

129
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,200
also add a mix of different exercises. I'll save the plan and then I'm just going to launch it.

130
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,960
And while running the workout, I am going to drop in some personal notes of mine and even upload a

131
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,120
progress photo to show how flexible the feature really is. And just like we designed earlier,

132
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,879
I'm able to finish the workout early without having to complete every exercise. Now let's go ahead

133
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,240
and move into the program library to check out the specialized training programs that we recently

134
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,480
added. And there you go. It is a library, a planner and a workout companion, all at one place.

135
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,399
Now by this point, I'm hoping that we can all agree this doesn't feel just like a prototype

136
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,720
anymore. Because while other platforms struggle to make mobile apps actually work, rocket generates

137
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,919
real flutter apps that run seamlessly across both iOS and Android with true native performance.

138
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,839
And on top of that, it gives you a ready-made frame on the back end. So you can choose whether to

139
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,159
build a web app, a mobile app, or even an internal tool. Okay, so now that we've seen how the app

140
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,120
functions as a whole, it's time to add another feature because why not? That makes workouts more

141
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,959
practical in real life. And one feature that every fitness app needs is a reliable timer because

142
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,120
I don't want to open another app. So whether it's for rest periods, circuit training, or just

143
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,120
keeping workout structured, having a timer built directly into the dashboard makes the whole

144
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,320
experience more seamless. And to do that, we'll guide rocket with this prompt to get the feature

145
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,200
built in. Awesome. Now please create a timer in the home and dashboard. This should be at the front.

146
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Make the default time as two minutes, which can be customized and edited manually. Also,

147
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,560
below the timer have a selection from our existing workouts that the user can tap. So the timer

148
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,200
starts automatically displaying the workout. Okay, so the output for that gives us a dedicated timer

149
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,720
right here on our dashboard. It isn't just a standalone tool either. It also doubles as a quick

150
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,400
start option for any workout that we choose since all the routines we've created are listed right

151
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,240
below it. And that way we can jump straight into training without any extra steps. So to showcase

152
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,120
this, I'm going to go ahead and run through a quick test. I'll adjust the timer settings here

153
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,079
by changing the minutes. I'm also going to try out the reset, start, and stop buttons just to make

154
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,360
sure everything works smoothly. And after that, I'm just going to go ahead and pick one of the workouts

155
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,679
from the mile workout section. And just like we planned, the timer automatically starts with that

156
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:29,439
routine that I just chose. Now, so when it comes to fitness, right, fitness apps, nothing's more

157
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:36,559
motivating than actually seeing your own progress. And that's why the final piece we're adding is a

158
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:43,839
proper progress tracker, something that goes beyond just logging workouts and really shows us how far

159
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,039
we've come. So I'm going to ask Rocket to build out a full progress section stats, body measurements,

160
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,879
and photo tracking to tie everything together, something like this. Great job Rocket. Now let's focus

161
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:03,279
on building the progress tracking feature and statistics. Please build the progress section and

162
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,679
allow the user to track their progress with advanced statistics that show personal records and

163
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:16,240
progression. Also add a body measurements tracker for weight and vitals and give the ability to

164
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,720
upload and add photos of the user's progress. And the output for that shows that the app now has a

165
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,799
working progress tracking section and everything inside of it is functional and it is ready to use.

166
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,240
So let's go ahead and try to upload a simple progress photo, then track my weight and body part

167
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,799
measurements here. And instantly the analytics will pop up showing clear stats and progression trends.

168
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,360
It's surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers and the visuals all line up and it's all

169
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,919
proof that the workouts and routines are paying off. At this point the app has plenty of features

170
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:58,000
but without accounts and authentication it really is just a single user experience. So in order to

171
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,840
make it feel like a complete platform our next step is to hook it up with Superbase and add proper

172
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,799
login and sign up pages. The setup starts by heading over to my Superbase here, creating a new

173
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:16,799
project then going into the integration panel back in rocket and then just linking that project

174
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,639
into our app. And once that's ready here's the prompt we'll use. Now please integrate Superbase

175
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:29,519
and create the login and sign up pages. Also make sure that the profile section shows the logged in

176
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,759
user. And with that rocket takes care of the integration and generates a clean authentication flow.

177
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:43,279
We now have dedicated login and sign up screens along with user account handling powered by Superbase.

178
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:49,039
And along with that the app automatically pulls in profile information so that our logged in

179
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,680
user's name shows up right here on the dashboard and in the profile section. And this isn't just a

180
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:02,640
demo either because when rocket adds Superbase authentication or later on strike payments it is

181
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,960
production ready functionality. It's not placeholder code. So you can connect your accounts and then

182
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,320
start processing real logins or payments right away. And with that let's go ahead and test all of

183
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,560
that out. I'm going to create a fresh account here. I'm going to sign in and I'm going to move

184
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,240
into the app and everything so far works smoothly. The sign up goes through the login directs me

185
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,840
straight to my dashboard and my name displays exactly where it should. All right so far we've built

186
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:36,159
a ton of features tracking and authentication but to really turn this into a business we need a way

187
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,599
to monetize it and we'll be needing stripe here and the idea here is simple which is to give users a

188
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,679
smooth upgrade path so that they can unlock everything that our app has to offer. And to do that

189
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,480
I'm going to head over to my stripe. I'm going to grab the publishable and secret keys and then

190
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,679
I'm simply going to plug them into rockets integration panel under the stripe section. And after

191
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,039
setting that up I'm just going to drop in this final prompt. Great job rocket. Now lastly please

192
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,600
integrate stripe and have a simple checkout link using the keys that I provided. Please create a

193
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,880
new section called upgrade and within that section show the details and benefits of our apps premium

194
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,400
upgrade at the bottom of the section. We have a checkout button which redirects to stripe and with

195
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,360
that prompt rocket instantly adds an upgrade tab to our app right here and inside users can see

196
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,040
exactly what premium offers. Advanced tracking, expanded features and all the little extras that we

197
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,080
added earlier that set it apart. There's also a checkout button that connects directly to stripe.

198
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,400
So subscribing really just takes one click and once the subscription goes through the app confirms

199
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,560
the account is premium and then it unlocks all of that good gated content. All right so now I'm

200
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,320
going to try and see if all of this works out. So let's navigate to the new upgrade section here.

201
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,200
Let's go ahead and review the benefits. Let's hit checkout and now complete a test subscription.

202
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,040
And right after that as you can see the dashboard updates with a premium status. No hiccups, no confusion.

203
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,880
And now that stripe is in place the app officially has everything it needs to not just support our

204
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,880
users but also sustain itself as a real product. And for the final run through I'm going to go ahead

205
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,800
and start things off by creating a brand new account. Say calling it fit rocket because why not.

206
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,720
And after signing in I'll move to the app the way any user would checking out each section as if

207
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,400
I'm using it for the first time. Now here in the workouts tab I'm going to put together a custom

208
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,040
routine. I'm going to add a few personal notes and I'll upload a quick progress photo before

209
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,480
finishing the session to show how flexible the feature is. And after that I'm going to head over to

210
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,759
the timer here and I'm going to play around with it setting it to say 10 minutes just to test how

211
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,279
smooth it feels. Then I'll jump into the program library. I'm going to pick out a training program

212
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,920
and I'm going to walk through the routines and subcategories that it comes with. And from there

213
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:11,200
I'll visit the exercise library and pull up some of the detailed instructions for individual exercises.

214
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,840
I'll also log my weight and my body measurements in the progress tracker so that we can see how that

215
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,279
data gets recorded. Lastly I'll open up the upgrade section here. I'm going to go through the

216
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:29,600
premium checkout flow and then I'm going to reload the app to confirm that my profile now shows premium

217
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,799
status. And it's the complete experience now from signing up as a new user to unlocking every single

218
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,079
feature. Alright that's a wrap on today's video. I'll catch you down here in the comments section

219
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,240
below. I'm always looking forward to hearing your feedback and of course thank you for spending

220
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,639
your time with me today and I'll definitely catch you at the next one. Thanks for watching.
