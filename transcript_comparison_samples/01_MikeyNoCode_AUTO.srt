1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
Have you ever wondered how apps like

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,680
this one are making $500,000

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,480
every single month? And well, what if I

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,719
told you that I just built an exact copy

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,639
of this million-doll app without writing

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,240
a single line of code? Now, I can hear

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,160
you thinking already, but if you check

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
out this screenshot, you can see proof

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,560
of the revenue that this type of app

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,320
generates through the app store. Half a

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,160
million dollars every month. And here's

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,560
a crazier part. I used only one AI tool

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
to build the entire thing. Now, most

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
people think that you need years of

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,040
coding experience or a whole team of

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,879
developers to create profitable apps,

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,200
but that's completely wrong. I'm about

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,000
to show you the exact stepby-step

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,719
process that I use to recreate this

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,280
successful workout tracking app, connect

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,440
it to Stripe for payments, and set up

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,199
all the premium features without

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,320
touching a single line of code. By the

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,640
way, my name is Mikey M I K E Y and I've

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,039
been experimenting with AI development

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,000
tools for the past year. And what I

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,320
discovered is that there's one AI coding

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,720
tool right now that's absolutely

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,680
crushing everything else. And it can

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,960
literally build entire apps for you. In

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,439
this video, I'm going to walk you

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,840
through my complete process. I'm gonna

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,560
show you the exact tool that I used and

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm going to prove that anyone, you, me,

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
even complete beginners can build

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,080
profitable apps in 2025. So, if you've

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,880
ever wanted to create your own app or

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,960
make money from app development or we're

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,520
just super curious about what's possible

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
with AI right now, this video, I promise

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
you, is going to blow your mind. So,

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,640
let's go ahead and dive right in. The AI

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
tool that will take care of everything

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,079
for us today in this video will be

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,600
Rocket. new. I added a special link in

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,960
the description below so you can go

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,840
ahead and check it out for yourself,

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,640
too. So, whenever I'm starting with a

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,200
new app build, the very first thing that

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,360
I want to do is get a layout down,

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
something that shows you how everything

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,680
will be structured before we begin

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,320
layering in features. It's pretty much

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,399
like sketching the blueprint of a house

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,479
before deciding on the furniture. Now,

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,120
this first step will give us a clear

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,879
picture of how the app will flow and

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
it'll also set the foundation for

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
everything we're going to add in later.

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
So, for this build, again, we'll be

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,360
using Rocket. And one of the biggest

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
advantages here of using Rocket is code

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
ownership. Unlike other platforms that

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,160
lock you in, you own your own code

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,560
completely. You can download it, you can

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,560
modify it, you can host it anywhere you

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,360
want. Even if you cancel your

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,040
subscription, your apps and your code

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,319
remain yours forever. All right, so

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,720
here's what we're going to tell Rocket.

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,760
Hey, Rocket, let's build an awesome

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,879
mobile fitness app. First, please build

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,360
the UI of the app. Then, we'll add some

74
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,319
features afterwards. Please build all

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,400
the sections and the navbar needed. All

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,080
right, before we move on, important

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,560
disclaimer here because building apps

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
and making money online is not easy

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,879
despite what other YouTubers might be

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,200
saying. So, when I show you how to build

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,840
an app, for example, I'm demonstrating

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
the technical process and the potential.

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,879
I am not guaranteeing your results.

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,400
These AI tools are legit, and as you'll

85
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,159
see, the techniques do work, but

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
success, as with all things in life,

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,000
depends on your execution, your timing,

88
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,080
and honestly, some luck. Now, most apps

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,480
don't make money right away. and many

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,239
don't even make money at all. So, I'm

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
not promising you're going to get rich

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
or that you go out and quit your job

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,080
after this video. Now, this is not

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,959
financial advice or a get-rich quick

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,599
scheme. I'm just showing you what's

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,159
possible with these tools and what you

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,080
do with that knowledge is up to you. All

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,920
right, so with those expectations set,

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,319
let's go ahead and continue building

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,200
this app. So, Rocket responds by putting

101
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,680
together a clean, elegant design for our

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,400
fitness app. All the major sections are

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
there. The placeholders are neatly set

104
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
and the overall look already feels

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,080
polished even at this early stage. It is

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,000
simple but it gives us a working canvas

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
that we can start refining right away.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
So let's go ahead and look through the

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,319
app. And you can see here that the

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,959
structure is functional. But there is a

111
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,519
small error. The navbar doesn't appear

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,639
on the home screen which might make the

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,800
navigation look incomplete at first. But

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,120
if I do tap into one of the sections,

115
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,680
the navbar appears and it works as

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,600
expected. So it is a promising start.

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,400
But the next step will make sure that

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,720
the navbar shows up everywhere so that

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,720
our navigation feels seamless from the

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
very beginning. Now that we've got the

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,600
basic layout in place, we are now going

122
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,080
to go ahead and take things up a notch.

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,040
Now the first version gave us a solid

124
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,600
foundation, but the design still feels

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,800
pretty bare bones to me. and that navbar

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,759
isn't showing up consistently across our

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,840
app. So, what I want next is a cleaner,

128
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
more modern look that works like a

129
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,400
proper fitness app and of course a fully

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,320
working navbar that ties the whole

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
experience together. So, to accomplish

132
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,919
all of that, here's what we're going to

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,320
ask Rocket. Great job, Rocket. Now,

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,880
please improve the app's design. Give it

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
a modern exercise look and add a navbar

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,280
and the other sections we may need.

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,919
focus on this first, then we'll build

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,240
more functionality later. And Rocket

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,400
comes back with a much more polished

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,880
design. As you can see, the layout has

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,800
been updated to look like a real

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,039
exercise app. It's modern, it's

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,680
cohesive, and it's visually appealing.

144
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,400
On top of all of that, we now have a

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,720
responsive navbar that shows up

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,639
consistently, which does let us move

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,479
smoothly between different sections.

148
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,600
Now, another cool thing here is that

149
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,919
Rocket just doesn't design from scratch.

150
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,080
Say you already have a mockup sitting in

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,400
Figma. Well, you can upload that

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,199
directly into Rocket and it will turn it

153
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,600
into production ready code with pixel

154
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,919
perfect accuracy. And that means no

155
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,240
messy handoffs to other developers and

156
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,400
no it doesn't match the design kind of

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
frustrations because your app looks

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,479
exactly how you imagined it and designed

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,560
it. And speaking of design, you can see

160
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,720
the difference here right away. In this

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,360
updated build, the sections are more

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,919
connected, the design flows better, and

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,319
that navbar ties everything together in

164
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,400
a way that makes navigation seamless.

165
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,960
Now, this upgrade gives us the

166
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,600
confidence to move forward. Knowing that

167
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
our app doesn't just work structurally,

168
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,720
but also looks the part. Okay, so a

169
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,960
fitness app without a workout tracker

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,520
doesn't really make much sense. So, this

171
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,080
is where we start building out the core

172
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,800
functionality. And the goal here is to

173
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,800
let our users create their own workouts,

174
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,280
track their own progress, and have that

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,440
flexibility to manage sessions however

176
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,600
they want. So, let's make that happen by

177
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,680
sending Rocket this kind of prompt.

178
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,000
Great job, Rocket. Let's focus on

179
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,720
building the actual functionality.

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,440
Please create a workout tracker and a

181
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
creator feature where the user can

182
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,720
create their own custom workouts and

183
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,120
track their progress in said workouts.

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,440
Give them the ability to add notes and

185
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,680
progress photos in the workout plans

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,440
they created. Also, give them the

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,080
ability to add exercises or sets while a

188
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,000
workout they created is in progress.

189
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,560
Lastly, give them the ability to be able

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,360
to finish workouts that they started at

191
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,840
any time without completing all the

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,400
exercises. And now, the workflow

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,039
delivers a fully functional workout

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,440
tracker inside of our app. And our users

195
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,360
can now design custom workout plans.

196
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,759
They can attach notes. They can include

197
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,599
their own progress photos and add or

198
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
remove sets as they go. And one of the

199
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,560
best parts is that workouts, they don't

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,199
have to be fully completed to end a

201
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,840
session. And this gives our users more

202
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,680
realistic control over how they train.

203
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,759
Okay, so let's go ahead and try all of

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
that out. I'll create a workout called,

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,599
say, calisthenics. And I'm going to

206
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,680
start adding exercises. So first I'll

207
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,960
add some push-ups and then some planks.

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
But I'm also going to go ahead and try

209
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,800
to delete the planks. And there you go,

210
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,280
the delete button works. And if

211
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,919
something ever doesn't work, as

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,800
expected, Rocket's builtin error

213
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,120
detection will spot it and then offers a

214
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,879
one-click fix. So instead of having to

215
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
dig through a bunch of code, we can just

216
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,720
hit fix it and then move on. And after

217
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
checking that, I'll follow it up with

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
some burpees. I'll save the workout. And

219
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,520
then now I'm going to activate it. From

220
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,320
here, the app lets me run the workout.

221
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,000
And if I decide to finish early, I can

222
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,880
go ahead and close it out without

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
needing to complete every last set. So,

224
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,760
it's flexible, it's practical, and it

225
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,800
feels like a real fitness tracker that

226
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,440
adapts to our users. Every good fitness

227
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,080
app needs a knowledge base that users

228
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,800
can rely on, not just for tracking their

229
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,360
own workouts, but also for guidance and

230
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,519
for ideas. And right now, the library

231
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,920
section in our app has just been

232
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,160
placeholder. So, it's now time to turn

233
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,399
that into a real resource. And this

234
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,560
means giving our users access to a

235
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,720
complete workout database filled with

236
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,880
details and instructions that they can

237
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,720
use at any time. So, here's the prompt

238
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
we're going to send over to Rocket to

239
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,360
make that all happen. Awesome job,

240
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,279
Rocket. Now, please build the workout

241
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,760
library/database.

242
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,480
create a thorough database with

243
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,200
instructions and details for several

244
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,839
workouts ranging from cardio,

245
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,360
weightlifting, calisthenics, and body

246
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,760
weight and the like. And with that,

247
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,839
Rocket built out a full workout library

248
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
inside of our app. And now, instead of

249
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,560
empty placeholders, that section is now

250
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,560
populated with a variety of exercises

251
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,279
across different categories. And each

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,600
entry comes with clear instructions and

253
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,720
details so that our users can follow

254
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,560
along and incorporate new routines into

255
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,880
their own training. Doing this

256
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,279
transforms the library into more than

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,080
just a section of the app. It's now a

258
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,920
built-in guide to help our users reach

259
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,320
their fitness goals. All right, let's go

260
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,080
ahead and explore this new database. So,

261
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
I'm going to head into the library here

262
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,680
and I'm going to start scrolling through

263
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,200
some of the options. Now, unlike before

264
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,600
where everything just kind of looked

265
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,079
empty and unfinished, this section, as

266
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,160
you can see, now holds real content. And

267
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,800
like what I said earlier, the workout

268
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,200
entry now includes instructions and

269
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,320
details, which makes our app much more

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,399
complete and gives our users a reliable

271
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,480
source of reference whenever they need

272
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,480
or want to try something new in their

273
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,200
programming. We all know that workouts

274
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,399
are great on their own, but many people

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,360
do prefer following structured programs

276
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,680
that lay out routines week by week. So,

277
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,560
for this next step, I want to expand our

278
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,720
library into something bigger, not just

279
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,040
individual workouts, but full-on

280
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,680
training programs like starting strength

281
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,079
and strong lifts 5x5. This will give

282
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,000
users a clear road map complete with

283
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,320
principles and progression instead of

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
just leaving them to piece things

285
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,560
together on their own. And to do that,

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
all it takes is this prompt and Rocket

287
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,640
will handle the rest for us. Awesome

288
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,040
job, Rocket. Now, please expand our

289
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,920
application by creating optimized

290
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,160
programs in our workout library. Please

291
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,200
create optimized programs such as

292
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,120
starting strength, strong lifts, 5x5,

293
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,240
and the like. And from that prompt, we

294
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,640
get an expanded program library right

295
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,279
inside of our app. So instead of just

296
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,839
exercises, we now have full-fledged

297
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,800
programs that break down training into

298
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,360
steps, routines, and guiding principles.

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,000
And these programs provide structure for

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,480
anyone who wants a proven system to

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,800
follow like 5x5. And they even include

302
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
the extra details like nutrition advice

303
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,800
to keep the experience well-rounded. All

304
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
right, so check this out. We can see

305
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,519
here under the new program section a

306
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,160
full list of structured and training

307
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,440
plans is ready to explore and opening

308
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,000
them up reveals complete routines, clear

309
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,959
principles and supporting details that

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,360
you know go beyond just exercises, even

311
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,279
touching on nutrition. Now, compared to

312
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
where we started off in this video, this

313
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,320
addition turns our app into a guide that

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,800
can now carry our users through an

315
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,800
entire fitness journey all step by step.

316
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,120
Now, after all that building and

317
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,959
refining, I think it's now finally time

318
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
to, you know, step back and see how

319
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,040
everything comes together. So, I'm going

320
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,279
to walk you through the app section by

321
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,440
section. Now, here, each part looks

322
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,240
complete and it's all connected now

323
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,079
seamlessly. Our app no longer is just a

324
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
collection of features, but it is a

325
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,480
cohesive fitness platform. So, let's put

326
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
the workout creator to the test. I'll go

327
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,480
into the workout section here. I'm going

328
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,959
to start building a new routine. I'll

329
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,720
also add a mix of different exercises.

330
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,920
I'll save the plan and then I'm just

331
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,480
going to launch it. And while running

332
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,200
the workout, I am going to drop in some

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,760
personal notes of mine and even upload a

334
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,240
progress photo to show how flexible the

335
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,880
feature really is. And just like we

336
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,040
designed earlier, I'm able to finish the

337
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,200
workout early without having to complete

338
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,519
every exercise. Now, let's go ahead and

339
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,519
move into the program library to check

340
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,680
out these specialized training programs

341
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,560
that we recently added. And there you

342
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,040
go. It is a library, a planner, and a

343
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
workout companion all in one place. Now,

344
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,920
by this point, I'm hoping that we can

345
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,680
all agree this doesn't feel just like a

346
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,320
prototype anymore. Because while other

347
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,440
platforms struggle to make mobile apps

348
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,920
actually work, Rocket generates real

349
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,360
Flutter apps that run seamlessly across

350
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,200
both iOS and Android with true native

351
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,839
performance. And on top of that, it

352
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,320
gives you a readymade frame on the back

353
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,120
end. So you can choose whether to build

354
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,200
a web app, a mobile app, or even an

355
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,839
internal tool. Okay, so now that we've

356
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,360
seen how the app functions as a whole,

357
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,639
it's, you know, time to add another

358
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
feature because why not? That makes

359
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,800
workouts more practical in real life.

360
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,199
And one feature that every fitness app

361
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
needs is a reliable timer because I

362
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,320
don't want to open another app. So

363
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,320
whether it's for rest periods, circuit

364
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,240
training, or just keeping workout

365
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,800
structured, having a timer built

366
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,120
directly into the dashboard makes the

367
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,040
whole experience more seamless. And to

368
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,040
do that, we'll guide Rocket with this

369
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,240
prompt to get the feature built in.

370
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,639
Awesome. Now, please create a timer in

371
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,440
the home and dashboard. This should be

372
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,600
at the front. Make the default time as 2

373
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,800
minutes, which can be customized and

374
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,519
edited manually. Also below the timer

375
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,240
have a selection from our existing

376
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,880
workouts that the user can tap. So the

377
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,040
timer starts automatically displaying

378
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,680
the workout. Okay, so the output for

379
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,000
that gives us a dedicated timer right

380
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,160
here on our dashboard. It isn't just a

381
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,800
standalone tool either. It also doubles

382
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,720
as a quick start option for any workout

383
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,040
that we choose since all the routines

384
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,120
we've created are listed right below it.

385
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,760
and that way we can jump straight into

386
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,760
training without any extra steps. So to

387
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,760
showcase this, I'm going to go ahead and

388
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,399
run through a quick test. I'll adjust

389
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
the timer settings here by changing the

390
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,160
minutes. I'm also going to try out the

391
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,320
reset start and stop buttons just to

392
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,760
make sure everything works smoothly. And

393
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,480
after that, I'm just going to go ahead

394
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,639
and pick one of the workouts from the my

395
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,360
workouts section. And just like we

396
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
planned, the timer automatically starts

397
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,519
with that routine that I just chose.

398
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,320
Now, so when it comes to fitness, right,

399
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,360
fitness apps, nothing's more motivating

400
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,760
than actually seeing your own progress.

401
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,880
And that's why the final piece we're

402
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,440
adding is a proper progress tracker,

403
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,920
something that goes beyond just logging

404
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,399
workouts and really shows us how far

405
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,360
we've come. So, I'm going to ask Rocket

406
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,839
to build out a full progress section,

407
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,920
stats, body measurements, and photo

408
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,000
tracking to tie everything together.

409
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,079
something like this. Great job, Rocket.

410
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,240
Now, let's focus on building the

411
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,720
progress tracking feature and

412
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,880
statistics. Please build the progress

413
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,360
section and allow the user to track

414
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,920
their progress with advanced statistics

415
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
that show personal records and

416
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,160
progression. Also add a body

417
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,880
measurements tracker for weight and

418
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,839
vitals and give the ability to upload

419
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,680
and add photos of the user's progress.

420
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,639
And the output for that shows that the

421
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,040
app now has a working progress tracking

422
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,199
section and everything inside of it is

423
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,800
functional and it is ready to use. So

424
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,040
let's go ahead and try to upload a

425
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,360
simple progress photo, then track my

426
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,079
weight and body part measurements here

427
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,320
and instantly the analytics will pop up

428
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,560
showing clear stats and progression

429
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,560
trends. It's surprisingly satisfying to

430
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,320
watch the numbers and the visuals all

431
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,560
line up, and it's all proof that the

432
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,360
workouts and the routines are paying

433
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,440
off. At this point, the app has plenty

434
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,680
of features, but without accounts and

435
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
authentication, it really is just a

436
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,639
single user experience. So, in order to

437
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
make it feel like a complete platform,

438
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,120
our next step is to hook it up with

439
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,679
Superbase and add proper login and

440
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,079
signup pages. The setup starts by

441
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,720
heading over to my Superbase here,

442
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,039
creating a new project, then going into

443
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,199
the integration panel back in Rocket,

444
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,199
and then just linking that project into

445
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,360
our app. And once that's ready, here's

446
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,559
the prompt we'll use. Now, please

447
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,039
integrate Superbase and create the login

448
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,679
and sign up pages. Also, make sure that

449
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,600
the profile section shows the loggedin

450
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,400
user. And with that, Rocket takes care

451
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,039
of the integration and generates a clean

452
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,480
authentication flow. And we now have

453
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,799
dedicated login and signup screens along

454
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,960
with user account handling powered by

455
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,120
Superbase. And along with that, the app

456
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,840
automatically pulls in profile

457
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,240
information so that our logged in users

458
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,880
name shows up right here on the

459
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,880
dashboard and in the profile section.

460
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,520
And this isn't just a demo either

461
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,600
because when Rocket adds Superbase

462
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,080
authentication or later on Stripe

463
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,480
payments, it is production ready

464
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,720
functionality. It's not placeholder

465
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,440
code. So you can connect your accounts

466
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
and then start processing real login or

467
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
payments right away. And with that,

468
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,559
let's go ahead and test all of that out.

469
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm going to create a fresh account

470
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,160
here. I'm going to sign in and I'm going

471
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,480
to move into the app. And everything so

472
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,799
far works smoothly. The signup goes

473
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,360
through. The login directs me straight

474
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,120
to my dashboard and my name displays

475
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,520
exactly where it should. All right. So

476
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,840
far, we've built a ton of features,

477
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,840
tracking, and authentication. But to

478
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,600
really turn this into a business, we

479
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,679
need a way to monetize it. And we'll be

480
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,840
needing Stripe here. And the idea here

481
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,080
is simple, which is to give users a

482
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,640
smooth upgrade path so that they can

483
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,400
unlock everything that our app has to

484
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,559
offer. And to do that, I'm going to head

485
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
over to my Stripe. I'm going to grab the

486
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,400
publishable and secret keys. And then

487
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,480
I'm simply going to plug them into

488
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,320
Rocket's integration panel under the

489
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,320
Stripe section. And after setting that

490
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,799
up, I'm just going to drop in this final

491
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,360
prompt. Great job, Rocket. Now, lastly,

492
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,919
please integrate Stripe and have a

493
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,720
simple checkout link using the keys that

494
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,280
I provided. Please create a new section

495
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,919
called upgrade. And within that section,

496
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,400
show the details and benefits of our

497
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,480
app's premium upgrade. At the bottom of

498
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,880
the section, we have a checkout button

499
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,840
which redirects to Stripe. And with that

500
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,640
prompt, Rocket instantly adds an upgrade

501
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,640
tab to our app right here. And inside,

502
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,039
users can see exactly what Premium

503
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,039
offers. Advanced tracking, expanded

504
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,960
features, and all the little extras that

505
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,559
we added earlier that set it apart.

506
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,559
There's also a checkout button that

507
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,960
connects directly to Stripe. So,

508
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,120
subscribing really just takes one click.

509
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,240
And once the subscription goes through,

510
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,559
the app confirms the account is premium

511
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,799
and then it unlocks all of that good

512
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,559
gated content. All right, so now I'm

513
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,200
going to try and see if all of this

514
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,039
works out. So let's navigate to the new

515
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,120
upgrade section here. Let's go ahead and

516
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,440
review the benefits. Let's hit checkout

517
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,799
and now complete a test subscription.

518
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,200
And right after that, as you can see,

519
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,360
the dashboard updates with a premium

520
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
status. No hiccups, no confusion. And

521
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,840
now that Stripe is in place, the app

522
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,480
officially has everything it needs to

523
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,039
not just support our users, but also

524
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,720
sustain itself as a real product. And

525
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,400
for the final run through, I'm going to

526
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,799
go ahead and start things off by

527
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,960
creating a brand new account, say

528
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,320
calling it Fit Rocket because why not?

529
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
And after signing in, I'll move through

530
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,000
the app the way any user would, checking

531
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,080
out each section as if I'm using it for

532
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,919
the first time. Now, here in the

533
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,080
workouts tab, I'm going to put together

534
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,000
a custom routine. I'm going to add a few

535
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,840
personal notes and I'll upload a quick

536
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,159
progress photo before finishing the

537
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,080
session to show how flexible the feature

538
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,400
is. And after that, I'm going to head

539
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
over to the timer here and I'm going to

540
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
play around with it, setting it to say

541
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,799
10 minutes just to test how smooth it

542
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
feels. Then I'll jump into the program

543
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,159
library. I'm going to pick out a

544
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,400
training program and I'm going to walk

545
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,320
through the routines and subcategories

546
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,280
that it comes with. And from there, I'll

547
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,679
visit the exercise library and pull up

548
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,640
some of the detailed instructions for

549
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,200
individual exercises. I'll also log my

550
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,600
weight and my body measurements in the

551
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,240
progress tracker so that we can see how

552
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,640
that data gets recorded. Lastly, I'll

553
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,559
open up the upgrade section here. I'm

554
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
going to go through the premium checkout

555
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,280
flow and then I'm going to reload the

556
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,600
app to confirm that my profile now shows

557
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,480
premium status. And it's the complete

558
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,600
experience now from signing up as a new

559
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,440
user to unlocking every single feature.

560
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,520
All right, that's a wrap on today's

561
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,960
video. I'll catch you down here in the

562
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
comments section below. I'm always

563
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
looking forward to hearing your feedback

564
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,159
and of course, thank you for spending

565
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,600
your time with me today and I'll

566
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,240
definitely catch you at the next one.

567
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,240
Thanks for watching.
